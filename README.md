# Hiya! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Karl, and I'm a fullstack developer with 7+ years of experience. I'm a tech nerd who loves to deep-dive into new technologies. I'm a lover of all things âœ¨Typescriptâœ¨, and I enjoy working with all sorts of Javascript libraries and frameworks suchs as React, Astro, Bun, Node and Next.js.
